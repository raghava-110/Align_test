  "priorities": [
    "High: Verifying the entire end-to-end flow completes successfully in a single login session for all 3 records.",
    "High: Ensuring the 'Current Value' field is correctly processed and saved for each metric.",
    "High: Confirming that each of the 3 created metrics can be successfully found and added to the 'My KPIs' section on the dashboard.",
    "High: Validating the data-driven approach by correctly parsing and using data from the 3 Excel records.",
    "Medium: Verifying the conditional UI logic, such as the appearance of the 'Resets On' field only for 'Weekly' cadence and the correct interface for 'Formula' vs. 'Metric' value sources.",
    "Medium: Ensuring the application state is managed correctly between iterations, with no data leakage from one metric creation to the next."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Session Management: The user session could expire or become invalid during the sequential creation of three metrics, causing the test to fail mid-flow.",
    "State Management: The metric creation form might not reset properly between iterations, causing data from a previous metric to persist and interfere with the creation of the next one.",
    "Asynchronous Operations: The test's dependency on dynamic UI elements (modals, search results, conditional fields) could lead to race conditions and flaky test execution if explicit waits are not implemented correctly.",
    "Data Integrity: The new 'Current Value' field might not be saved or displayed correctly on the dashboard after creation.",
    "Test Data Dependency: The test is entirely dependent on the structure and content of the external Excel file. Any discrepancy in column headers, data format, or file availability will cause the test to fail.",
    "UI Element Locators: The note about the 'Edit KPI' button being a span element highlights a risk of brittle locators. Changes in the front-end implementation could easily break the automation script."
  ],
  "recommendations": "The primary recommendation is to build a robust, data-driven automation script that handles the entire E2E flow. Implement strong explicit waits for all asynchronous UI updates, such as modal dialogs opening, search results appearing, and the dashboard refreshing. The script's Excel parsing logic must be flexible enough to handle columns in any order and correctly interpret empty cells for optional fields. A post-test cleanup step (e.g., deleting the created metrics via UI or API) should be implemented to ensure the test environment remains clean for subsequent runs. It is also recommended to create separate negative test cases to validate error handling for invalid data, such as non-numeric 'Current Value' or incorrect formula construction."
