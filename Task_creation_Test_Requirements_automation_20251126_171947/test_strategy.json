  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful user login, company selection, and navigation to the Tasks page.",
    "High: Ability to create multiple tasks sequentially from an Excel file within a single session.",
    "High: Core task creation including entering a Task Name, Due Date, and submitting the form.",
    "Medium: Verification of all team member assignment types (individual emails, 'Assign to all Users', 'Assign to all Admins').",
    "Medium: Document upload functionality for both 'File' and 'Link' types.",
    "Low: Optional alignment with existing Priorities and Huddles."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Data Dependency: The test is highly dependent on the accuracy and validity of data in the external Excel file (credentials, company names, user emails, priorities, huddles).",
    "Dynamic UI Elements: The test relies on timed waits for autocomplete dropdowns (users, priorities, huddles), which can be a source of flakiness if the application response time varies.",
    "File Upload Mechanism: Interacting with a hidden file input element using JavaScript and depending on a hardcoded local file path ('C:\\Users\\sudhi\\Downloads\\') is fragile and not portable for CI/CD environments.",
    "Complex UI Interactions: The use of JavaScript for clicks and setting input values (e.g., document description) indicates potential flakiness with standard browser automation commands, possibly due to element overlays or framework complexities.",
    "Session Persistence: The test's design to process multiple tasks in a single session is at risk if the application has an aggressive session timeout or an unexpected logout occurs.",
    "Test Environment Consistency: The test assumes that specific users, priorities, and huddles exist in the test environment. Mismatches between the test data and the environment state will lead to failures."

  "recommendations": "Based on the requirements, it is recommended to: 1. Decouple the large end-to-end test into smaller, more focused automated tests for each major feature (e.g., one for bulk assignment, one for file upload, one for link attachment) to improve debugging and stability. 2. Abstract the file path dependency by placing test assets within the test project and using relative paths, removing the reliance on a specific local machine's file system. 3. Complement this UI-based test with API-level tests for task creation to validate a wider range of data permutations more efficiently and reliably. 4. Implement a pre-test setup step or script to ensure the test environment is seeded with the required users, priorities, and huddles listed in the test data file to reduce data-related failures. 5. Investigate and implement more robust element locators (e.g., unique 'data-testid' attributes) in collaboration with developers to reduce reliance on fallback strategies and JavaScript-based interactions."
