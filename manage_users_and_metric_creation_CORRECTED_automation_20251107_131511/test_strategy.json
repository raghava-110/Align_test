  "test_types": [
    "End-to-End Testing: The entire test case describes a complete user journey from login to final verification, making it a primary E2E test.",
    "Functional Testing: Each major step (Metric Creation, Add to KPI, Configure Target) is a discrete functional test.",
    "UI Testing: Verifying the correct appearance and behavior of UI components, such as the formula builder, conditional dropdowns, and the final metric card visualization.",
    "Integration Testing: The test inherently validates the integration between the User Management, Metrics, Dashboard, and Target Configuration modules.",
    "Data-Driven Testing: The requirements explicitly define an Excel-based data structure to run multiple scenarios with varying inputs for metrics and targets."

  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful execution of the end-to-end flow: Login -> Create Formula Metric -> Add to Dashboard -> Configure Target -> Verify on Dashboard.",
    "High: Validation of the Formula Builder functionality, including selecting two metrics and an operator, and confirming the formula.",
    "High: Correct configuration and saving of both 'Custom' and 'Time-Based' target types.",
    "Medium: Verification of conditional UI logic, such as the appearance of the 'Resets On' field only for 'Weekly' cadence.",
    "Medium: Validation of the alternative 'Value Source: Metric' path.",
    "Low: Testing all permutations of Cadence (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) and Operators (+, -, *, /) beyond a single successful path."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Formula Builder Logic: Potential for incorrect calculations, parsing errors, or failures when combining metrics with different data types or cadences.",
    "Dynamic UI Interactions: High risk of automation script failure due to elements that appear conditionally (e.g., 'Resets On' field) or on user interaction (e.g., hover-to-reveal three-dot menu).",
    "Element Identification Ambiguity: The requirement to identify the correct metric card among potential duplicates (Step 25) and the active dropdown menu (Step 28) presents a significant challenge for automation stability.",
    "State Management: The multi-step process (create metric, save, add to dashboard, save, edit target, save) relies on the application correctly maintaining state. A failure at any save point could invalidate the entire test.",
    "Data Integrity: Risk of data being saved incorrectly or not at all during the target configuration step, leading to a mismatch between the configured target and what is displayed on the dashboard."
  ],
  "recommendations": "The test strategy should prioritize building a robust automation framework capable of handling complex and dynamic UI elements. Create specific, reusable functions for challenging interactions like identifying the most recently added KPI card and interacting with hover-dependent menus. The specified data-driven approach using Excel should be fully implemented to maximize test coverage across different metric formulas, cadences, and target types. It is also recommended to expand the test data to include negative scenarios, such as invalid formulas or non-descending custom target values, to ensure proper error handling.",
