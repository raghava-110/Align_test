  "test_types": [
    "End-to-End Testing: The entire test case describes a complete user journey from login to final verification, covering multiple application modules.",
    "Functional Testing: Each step validates a specific function, such as user login, metric creation, form submission, and data persistence.",
    "UI Testing: The test includes steps to verify the visibility and state of various UI components like forms, modals, dropdowns, and buttons.",
    "Integration Testing: The test validates the integration between the User Management, Metrics, and Dashboard modules.",
    "Data-Driven Testing: The requirements specify an Excel data structure to drive the test with different configurations (e.g., Formula vs. Metric source, Custom vs. Time-Based target)."

  },
  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful completion of the end-to-end user flow: Login, Company Selection, Metric Creation (using Formula), Add to Dashboard, Configure Target, and Save.",
    "High: Correct functionality of the Formula Builder, including searching for existing metrics and applying mathematical operators.",
    "High: Accurate saving and display of the configured Custom or Time-Based target on the dashboard metric card.",
    "Medium: The user invitation and acceptance workflow, as it is a prerequisite for the main test objective.",
    "Medium: Verification of conditional UI elements, such as the 'Resets On' field for weekly cadence and the appearance of target-specific input fields.",
    "Low: Verification of all individual UI elements and text labels not directly impacting the core workflow."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Dynamic UI Interaction: The test relies on interacting with elements that appear on hover (three-dot menu) or conditionally based on user selections (e.g., 'Resets On' field, target type fields). These are common points of failure for automation scripts.",
    "Formula Builder Complexity: The formula builder involves multiple interactions (search, select metric, select operator, select second metric). Any issue in parsing, state management, or saving the formula will block the entire test case.",
    "Element Identification on Dashboard: The requirements explicitly note the risk of multiple metric cards with the same name and provide a strategy to select the correct one. This indicates a potential for test flakiness if the identification logic is not robust.",
    "State Management Across Pages: The workflow navigates from Metrics > Dashboard > Edit Metric > Dashboard. A failure to persist the state of the newly created metric or its configuration across these pages would result in test failure.",
    "Asynchronous Operations: The test involves numerous waits for modals, page loads, dashboard refreshes, and search results. Improper handling of these async operations could lead to race conditions and unstable test execution."
  ],
  "recommendations": "The test automation strategy should prioritize robust locator strategies, especially for dynamic and conditional UI elements mentioned in the requirements (e.g., the KPI card's three-dot menu). Implement explicit waits for all asynchronous actions like modal rendering, search result filtering, and page refreshes after saving. The data-driven approach using an Excel file should be implemented to cover all specified paths (Formula vs. Metric, Custom vs. Time-Based targets). Due to the risk of data conflicts from previous runs, a pre-test cleanup or a dynamic data generation strategy (e.g., using timestamps in metric names) is highly recommended to ensure test environment consistency."
