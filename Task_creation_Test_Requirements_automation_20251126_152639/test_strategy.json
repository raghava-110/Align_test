  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful user authentication, company selection, and navigation to the Tasks page.",
    "High: The core ability to create a task with a name and due date.",
    "High: The test's ability to process all rows from the Excel file in a single, persistent session.",
    "Medium: Verification of all three team member assignment methods (individual, all users, all admins).",
    "Medium: Successful document attachment functionality, including handling both 'File' and 'Link' types.",
    "Low: Verification of optional alignments to Priorities and Huddles, as they depend on pre-existing data."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "UI Flakiness: The test relies on JavaScript workarounds for document description and hidden file inputs, which can be unstable if the UI changes.",
    "Data Dependency: The test's success is highly dependent on the existence and correctness of data in the Excel file and the application (e.g., user emails, Priority/Huddle names, local file paths).",
    "Dynamic Waits: The test depends on fixed waits for asynchronous operations like autocomplete dropdowns, which can fail due to network latency or slow application response.",
    "Date Picker Interaction: Directly typing into a date field and pressing ENTER is a brittle interaction method that can break if the component's behavior changes.",
    "Session Management: An unexpected session timeout during the execution of a long list of tasks would cause subsequent tests to fail.",
    "Recovery Mechanism Limitations: The specified recovery mechanism (navigating back to the Tasks page) may not be sufficient for all types of failures, potentially leading to a cascade of errors."
  ],
  "recommendations": "Based on the requirements, it is recommended to enhance test stability by working with developers to add stable test locators (e.g., data-testid attributes) to elements that currently require JavaScript workarounds. To mitigate data dependency risks, implement a pre-test setup step (ideally via API) to create required test data like Priorities, Huddles, and confirm user existence. Consider expanding test coverage with separate negative test cases, such as using invalid data formats, attempting to upload incorrect file types, or handling server-side validation errors upon task submission. The fixed waits for dynamic elements should be replaced with more robust explicit waits that check for the element's state (e.g., visibility, clickability) to reduce timing-related failures.",
