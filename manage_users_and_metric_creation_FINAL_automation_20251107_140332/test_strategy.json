  "test_types": [
    "End-to-End Testing: The test case covers a complete user journey from login through user creation, metric creation, and dashboard configuration.",
    "Functional Testing: Each step verifies a specific application function, such as creating a user, building a formula, or saving a target.",
    "UI Testing: The test includes numerous steps to verify that UI components (forms, modals, buttons, dropdowns) are displayed and behave as expected.",
    "Data-Driven Testing: The core design of the test is data-driven, with all inputs being read from an external Excel file to allow for multiple iterations with different data sets.",
    "Regression Testing: This comprehensive workflow is a prime candidate for a regression suite to ensure core functionality remains intact after new code deployments."

  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful creation of a metric using the Formula Builder and saving it.",
    "High: Successfully adding the newly created metric to 'My Dashboard KPIs'.",
    "High: Correct configuration and saving of both 'Custom' and 'Time-Based' targets.",
    "High: Verification that the configured target is correctly displayed on the dashboard metric card.",
    "Medium: The user invitation and acceptance workflow.",
    "Medium: UI validation for conditional fields (e.g., 'Resets On' for Weekly cadence, target-specific input fields).",
    "Low: Verification of non-critical UI elements like confirmation messages that don't block the main workflow."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Data Integrity: The entire test is dependent on the external Excel file. Incorrect or missing data in the sheet will cause test failures.",
    "Dynamic UI and Timing Issues: The test involves elements that appear on hover (three-dot menu), conditional fields based on user selection, and asynchronous loading of data (search results, modal content). These are common points of failure for automation due to timing and synchronization challenges.",
    "Complex Element Identification: The requirements explicitly note challenges in locating the correct metric card among potential duplicates and identifying the active dropdown menu. This indicates a risk of interacting with the wrong element, leading to false negatives.",
    "Workflow Complexity and Branching: The test contains multiple conditional paths (Value Source: Formula vs. Metric; Target Type: Custom vs. Time-Based). Flaws in the test script's logic for handling these branches could lead to incomplete or incorrect test execution.",
    "State Management: The test navigates through numerous pages, modals, and forms. An unexpected state change or failure to transition correctly between pages could break the entire end-to-end flow."
  ],
  "recommendations": "1. Implement a robust Page Object Model (POM) to separate UI element locators and interactions from the test logic, improving maintainability. 2. Use explicit waits extensively to handle dynamic and asynchronous UI elements, avoiding fixed delays which lead to flaky tests. 3. Develop a resilient locator strategy for complex elements like the metric cards and dropdowns, potentially using a combination of attributes, text, and indexing to uniquely identify them. 4. Create a dedicated data reader utility to parse the specified Excel file, including error handling for missing columns or invalid data formats. 5. The test script must accurately implement the conditional logic for branching paths (Formula vs. Metric source, Custom vs. Time-Based target) based on the input data. 6. A pre-test and post-test strategy is essential. This includes ensuring prerequisite metrics for formulas exist before the test runs and implementing a clean-up process to delete created users and metrics after the test to ensure a consistent test environment."
