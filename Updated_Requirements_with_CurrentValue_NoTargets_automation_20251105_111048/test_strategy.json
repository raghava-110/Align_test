  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful single-session execution of the entire flow for all 3 records without session loss.",
    "High: Correct data persistence and retrieval from the Excel sheet for each of the 3 metric creation loops.",
    "High: Accurate creation of metrics with the new 'Current Value' field and verification on the dashboard.",
    "High: Successful addition of all 3 created metrics to the 'My KPIs' section of the dashboard.",
    "Medium: Correct rendering of conditional UI elements, specifically the 'Resets On' field for 'Weekly' cadence and the different interfaces for 'Formula' vs. 'Metric' value sources.",
    "Medium: Validation of data entry in all form fields before saving each metric."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Session State Management: The application might fail to maintain the user's session or state across the three sequential metric creation cycles, potentially leading to errors or requiring re-authentication.",
    "Data Latency/Caching: A newly created metric might not be immediately available in the 'Edit KPI' modal for addition to the dashboard, causing the test to fail on the search/add step.",
    "Asynchronous UI Updates: The test automation may fail if it doesn't properly wait for UI elements to load, especially after selecting a 'Value Source', searching for metrics in the formula builder, or loading the 'Edit KPI' modal.",
    "Data-Driven Framework Failure: Errors in the Excel data (e.g., incorrect case, wrong data types, missing required conditional values) or the script's data-reading logic could cause test failures.",
    "Conditional Logic Bugs: The application may have defects in the logic that displays/hides the 'Resets On' field or switches between the 'Formula Builder' and 'Metric Selection' interfaces.",
    "Complex DOM Interaction: The requirements note that the 'Edit' button is a span, not a button element. Interacting with non-standard elements and complex modals can be fragile and prone to automation script failures."
  ],
  "recommendations": "Implement robust dynamic waits in the automation script to handle asynchronous page loads, modal pop-ups, and search result filtering, as mentioned multiple times in the requirements. The script should be modular, with separate functions for login, metric creation, and adding a KPI to the dashboard, to improve readability and reusability. Incorporate comprehensive error handling and logging to pinpoint the exact step and data record that causes a failure. Before test execution, ensure all prerequisite metrics needed for 'Formula' or 'Metric' value sources exist in the test environment to prevent cascading failures. The test data in the Excel file must be meticulously maintained and version-controlled alongside the test script.",
