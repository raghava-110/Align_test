  "priorities": [
    "High: Verifying the end-to-end flow of logging in once and creating three distinct metrics sequentially within a single session.",
    "High: Ensuring the new 'Current Value' field is correctly captured and saved for each metric.",
    "High: Validating the conditional logic for 'Value Source' (displaying Formula Builder vs. Metric Selection) and 'Cadence' (displaying 'Resets On' only for Weekly).",
    "High: Confirming that each newly created metric can be successfully located and added to the 'My KPIs' section of the dashboard.",
    "Medium: Validating the data-driven approach by ensuring the test correctly reads and processes all three records from the Excel source file.",
    "Medium: Verifying UI feedback, such as success messages after saving a metric and the dashboard refreshing correctly after adding a KPI."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Session Management: The entire test relies on a persistent user session. Any premature session timeout or forced logout between metric creations would cause the test to fail.",
    "Asynchronous Operations: The test involves multiple waits for UI elements to appear (password field, company list, search results, modals). Flaky tests could result from inadequate or improper wait times.",
    "Data Dependency: The 'Formula' and 'Metric' value sources require pre-existing metrics. If the test data in the Excel file specifies a metric that doesn't exist, that iteration will fail. The order of metric creation in the Excel file is critical if they depend on each other.",
    "UI State Changes: The dynamic rendering of the 'Resets On' field and the Formula Builder interface could be prone to rendering errors or state management bugs.",
    "Modal Interaction: Interacting with the 'Edit KPI' modal, including searching and moving items between panels, can be complex to automate and may have timing issues.",
    "Data Integrity: Incorrect parsing of data from the Excel file (e.g., treating numbers as text) could lead to input errors. The test's success is highly dependent on the accuracy and format of the source data."
  ],
  "recommendations": "The test strategy should focus on creating a robust, data-driven automation script. Implement explicit waits for all asynchronous elements, such as search results and modal dialogs, to prevent timing-related failures. The test data in the Excel file must be carefully managed; ensure any metrics used as a 'Value Source' (either for 'Formula' or 'Metric' types) already exist in the system or are created in a previous step within the same test run. It is also recommended to add verification points to check the actual calculated value of formula-based metrics on the dashboard, not just their presence and the entered 'Current Value'. Finally, this E2E test case should be a core part of the regression suite to ensure this critical multi-record creation workflow remains stable."
