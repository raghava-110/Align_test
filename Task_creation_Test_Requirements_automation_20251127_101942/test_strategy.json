  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful user authentication, company selection, and navigation to the Tasks page.",
    "High: Ability to create multiple tasks sequentially within a single login session.",
    "High: Core task creation including Task Name, Due Date, and successful submission.",
    "Medium: Correct handling of all three assignment types: individual emails, 'Assign to all Users', and 'Assign to all Admins'.",
    "Medium: Functionality of the document upload feature for both 'File' and 'Link' types.",
    "Low: Optional alignment to existing Priorities and Huddles, as these are not mandatory for task creation."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Dependency on pre-existing data: The test's success relies on the existence of specific users, Priorities, and Huddles in the test environment.",
    "UI Flakiness: The test depends on fixed waits (e.g., 2.5 seconds) for dynamic autocomplete dropdowns, which can fail if the application response time varies.",
    "Complex UI Interactions: Using JavaScript to make hidden elements visible (file input) or to set values (document description) can be brittle and may break with front-end code changes.",
    "External File Dependency: The file upload functionality requires a file to exist at a hardcoded local path, making the test non-portable and prone to failure if the file is missing or the path changes.",
    "Session Timeout: The test assumes the user session remains active while processing all tasks from the Excel file. A short session timeout could cause failures on subsequent tasks.",
    "Date Picker Logic: The test assumes it can directly input a date string. Changes to the date picker component that prevent direct input would break this step.",
    "Recovery Mechanism: The recovery plan to navigate back to the Tasks page upon failure might mask underlying issues and could lead to a loop if the navigation itself is the point of failure."
  ],
  "recommendations": "Based on the requirements, it is recommended to: 1. Replace fixed waits for dropdowns with dynamic explicit waits that check for the element's state (e.g., visibility, containing options) to improve reliability. 2. Parameterize the file upload base path instead of hardcoding it, allowing for greater test portability. 3. Implement a pre-test setup step to ensure all required test data (users, priorities, huddles) exists in the environment via API or database seeding. 4. Create separate, more focused test cases for negative scenarios, such as invalid date formats, non-existent users, or attempting to upload unsupported file types. 5. The heavy reliance on JavaScript for interactions should be reviewed; if possible, native user interactions should be prioritized to better simulate real user behavior.",
