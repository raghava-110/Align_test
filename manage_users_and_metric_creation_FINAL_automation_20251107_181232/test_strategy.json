  "test_types": [
    "End-to-End (E2E) Testing: The test case describes a complete user workflow across multiple application modules, from login to final verification.",
    "Functional Testing: Each step verifies a specific function, such as creating a user, building a formula, or saving a target.",
    "Integration Testing: The test validates the integration between the User Management, Metrics, and Dashboard modules.",
    "UI Testing: The test verifies the correct appearance and behavior of UI components based on user interactions.",
    "Data-Driven Testing: The methodology explicitly states that all test data values are provided from an Excel sheet, making it a data-driven test.",
    "Regression Testing: This comprehensive workflow is a prime candidate for a regression suite to ensure core functionality remains intact after new releases."

  },
  "priorities": [
    "High: Successful end-to-end flow from login, metric creation using the formula builder, adding it to the dashboard, and configuring a target. A failure in this core path invalidates the entire test objective.",
    "High: Correct functionality of the Formula Builder, including searching for metrics, applying operators, and validating the formula.",
    "High: Successful saving of the metric and the target configuration, and verifying the changes are correctly reflected on the 'My Dashboard KPIs' section.",
    "Medium: The user invitation and acceptance sub-flow. While a prerequisite for the main test, it's a separate module.",
    "Medium: Correct handling of conditional UI elements, such as the 'Resets On' field appearing only for 'Weekly' cadence.",
    "Low: Verification of non-critical UI elements like confirmation messages, as long as the primary functionality is successful."
  ],
  "risk_areas": [
    "Automation Brittleness: The test relies on complex UI interactions, such as hovering to reveal a hidden three-dot menu (Step 26) and identifying the correct metric card among potential duplicates (Step 25). These are common points of failure for automated scripts.",
    "Dynamic UI: The interface changes based on user selections (e.g., 'Value Source' selection displays different UI, 'Cadence' selection conditionally shows 'Resets On'). The automation must handle these dynamic changes reliably.",
    "Asynchronous Operations: The test script must handle numerous waits for pages to load, modals to appear, and save operations to complete. Inadequate or fixed-time waits can lead to flaky and unreliable test results.",
    "Data Dependency: The entire test is driven by an external Excel file. Errors in the test data, file path, or data parsing logic will cause test failures that are not related to application defects.",
    "State Management: The test spans multiple application modules (Admin, Metrics, Dashboard). A failure to maintain a consistent state (e.g., a newly created metric not being available in the dashboard modal) can break the flow.",
    "Locator Strategy: Identifying the correct, active dropdown menu (Step 28) and the specific metric card on a potentially crowded dashboard requires a precise and robust element location strategy."
  ],
  "recommendations": "Implement robust dynamic waits (e.g., 'wait for element to be visible/clickable') instead of fixed time delays to improve test stability against variations in application response time. Develop a highly specific locator strategy for identifying the correct metric card and its associated three-dot menu, as described in Step 25, to avoid failures due to duplicate metric names from previous test runs. A pre-test cleanup script to remove test-generated metrics and users is highly recommended to ensure a clean test environment for each run. The data-driven framework should include strong error handling for parsing the Excel file to distinguish between test data issues and application bugs. For the Formula Builder, consider creating separate, smaller component tests to cover a wider range of operator and metric combinations more efficiently than the full E2E test allows."
